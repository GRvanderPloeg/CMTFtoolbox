## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION text to use undirected quotation marks.
* Edited print statements in R/acmtf_opt.R; R/acmtfr_opt.R; R/cmtf_opt.R to be suppressable.
* Edited the ACMTF_modelSelection function to meet the <5s example runtime requirement.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
